A prototype of the Genius Square. The project is far from completion however the foundation is layed.

Keybinds:
W: Remove piece when selected
E: Rotate piece when selected
R: Reflect piece when selected
H: Hint

Note the hint system is in its infancy and currently only provides feedback on whether the board needs to have at most one piece removed to be solvable.
